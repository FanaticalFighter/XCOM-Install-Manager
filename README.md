# XCOM-Install-Manager
XCOM Install Manager allows you to have multiple installs of XCOM without them interfering. For example, you can have a Long War 1.0 install, a Long War Beta 14 install and a vanilla install, and XCOM Install Manager will help you to simply switch between the three installations.

## Installation
XCOM Install Manager needs no installation. Your download should include a file called `xcom_install_manager.py`. Put this file inside your XCOM Enemy Unkown installation folder (the one which includes the folder `XEW`).

To use XCOM Install Manager, you'll need Python 2.7, which is available on all platforms XCOM Enemy Within is available for.

## Usage
To use the Manager, for every install of XCOM Enemy Within that you have, rename them to something like `XEW - Long War` or `XEW - Vanilla` etc. You can also let one install be named simply as `XEW`.

Run the python script included. You might be prompted to enter the name of the currently default mod install (the mod currently in the `XEW` folder), or to enter a number for the default mod install to activate.

Whenever you want to change the mod that Steam launches, just open up this script, and type in the mod install that you want to activate, then simply launch the game from Steam.
